Emergent Problem:

Currently the start button doesn't work, and the deadline is tmr 10am, and there are still abunch of works must be done including:

a score counting feature, and an overlay to show the current level and score

could level up

But, firstly, the game have to start smoothly, and I couldn't achieve this by using the version at here. And the second is the AIs are guided by the scores, and the scroes may or may not counting by using collision, (if collisions are used then after that the object must be removed, but currently it seems like this feature didn't be implemented).

So, I am working on this at G12 today (till now) could you come by G12 so that we could finish these bugs? Otherwise, I have to figure out how to bypass these bugs.
